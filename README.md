# Payroll Management System

## Description
This is a **Payroll Management System** frontend built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The project consists of two dashboards—**Employee Dashboard** and **Manager Dashboard**—that streamline the payroll and timesheet management process within an organization.

- **Employee Dashboard**: The employee can manage their profile and access their worksheets. The dashboard provides a clear view of personal details, work hours, leave balances, and holidays.

- **Manager Dashboard**: The manager has access to a variety of administrative features such as:
  - **Add Consignee**: Manage the employee's consignees.
  - **Timesheet Management**: Add work hours, review and approve/reject submitted timesheets.
  - **Profile Management**: Manage and update personal profile information.
  
  The manager dashboard also includes four widgets providing at-a-glance information:
  - **Holidays**: Displays upcoming holidays.
  - **Leave Balances**: Overview of employees' remaining leave days.
  - **Current Time**: Displays the current system time.

This system is designed to make the payroll process more efficient and transparent, reducing manual errors and ensuring accuracy in employee payments and work hour management.
